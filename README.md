# The Private Torrent
The Private torrent is used for bypassing limit on torrent files which was given by websites, the program stops sending download information to the annouce url so that users can download unlimited files from those websites.

### How the torrent works
If you download any file using any torrent client then the file transfer from the Bittorrent network which uses Peer to Peer (P2P) connection. P2P network means the file is transferred by many computers using this Bittorrent network.

While downloading torrent, your torrent client connect to the uploader and neraby computers (called seeder) then it start downloading. It download files like idm, by parting the file. If the torrent file downloaded many times and too many peoples are seed the torrent then your download will be very fast than normal torrent file.

After your torrent client gets all part, it then merges and them and verifies the the data. The end result is the files present on your storage and this is how torrent works.

### What is seeders, peers and leechers?  
Seeder is a person who has complete file, means he has downloaded the complete file.

Peer is those persons who haven't downloaded completed file, they has pieces of the torrent data.

Leechers is thoes persons who downloaded complete files but they don't share his data to the seeders or peers.

## How the Program Works?  
Originally all operations are done by our Bittorrent client, If our client got seeding request then it seeds.

But the modified torrent client (For Windows) doesn't follow the rule. It stop sending announced url about download information, so that the announce url doesn't detect how many GBs are downloaded (But It has some limit).

## Download and Installation
